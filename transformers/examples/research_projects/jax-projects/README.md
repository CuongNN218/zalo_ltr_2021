# Flax/JAX community week ü§ó

Welcome to the Flax/JAX community week! The goal of this week is to make compute-intensive NLP and CV projects (like pre-training BERT, GPT2, CLIP, ViT) 
practicable for a wider audience of engineers and researchers. 
To do so, we will try to teach **you** how to effectively use JAX/Flax on TPU and help you to complete a fun NLP and/or CV project in JAX/Flax during the community week. 

Free access to a TPUv3-8 will kindly be provided by the Google Cloud team!

In this document, we list all the important information that you will need during the Flax/JAX community week.

Don't forget to sign up [here](https://forms.gle/tVGPhjKXyEsSgUcs8)!

## Organization

Participants can propose ideas for an interesting NLP and/or CV project. Teams of 3 to 5 will then be formed around the most promising and interesting projects. Make sure to read through the [Projects](#projects) section on how to propose projects, comment on other participants' project ideas, and create a team.

To help each team successfully finish their project, we have organized talks by leading scientists and engineers from Google, Hugging Face, and the open-source NLP & CV community. The talks will take place before the community week from June 30th to July 2nd. Make sure to attend the talks to get the most out of your participation! Check out the [Talks](#talks) section to get an overview of the talks, including the speaker and the time of the talk.

Each team is then given **free access to a TPUv3-8 VM** from July 7th to July 14th. In addition, we will provide training examples in JAX/Flax for a variety of NLP and Vision models to kick-start your project. During the week, we'll make sure to answer any questions you might have about JAX/Flax and Transformers and help each team as much as possible to complete their project!

At the end of the community week, each team should submit a demo of their project. All demonstrations will be evaluated by a jury and the top-3 demos will be awarded a prize. Check out the [How to submit a demo](#how-to-submit-a-demo) section for more information and suggestions on how to submit your project.

## Communication

All important communication will take place in an internal Slack channel, called `#flax-jax-community-week`. 
Important announcements of the Hugging Face, Flax/JAX, and Google Cloud team will be posted there. 
Such announcements include general information about the community week (Dates, Rules, ...), release of relevant training scripts (Flax/JAX example scripts for NLP and Vision), release of other important documents (How to access the TPU), etc. 
The Slack channel will also be the central place for participants to post about their results, share their learning experiences, ask questions, etc.

For issues with Flax/JAX, Transformers, Datasets or for questions that are specific to your project we would be **very happy** if you could use the following public repositories and forums:

- Flax: [Issues](https://github.com/google/flax/issues), [Questions](https://github.com/google/flax/discussions)
- JAX: [Issues](https://github.com/google/jax/issues), [Questions](https://github.com/google/jax/discussions)
- ü§ó Transformers: [Issues](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues), [Questions](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/transformers/9)
- ü§ó Datasets: [Issues](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues), [Questions](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/datasets/10)
- Project specific questions: [Forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/flax-jax-projects/22)
- TPU related questions: [TODO]()

Please do **not** post the complete issue/project-specific question in the Slack channel, but instead a link to your issue/question that we will try to answer as soon as possible. 
This way, we make sure that the everybody in the community can benefit from your questions - even after the community week - and that the same question is not answered twice.

To be invited to the Slack channel, please make sure you have signed up [on the Google form](https://forms.gle/tVGPhjKXyEsSgUcs8). 

**Note**: If you have signed up on the google form, but you are not in the Slack channel, please leave a message on [(TODO) the official forum announcement]( ) and ping `@Suzana` and `@patrickvonplaten`.

## Projects

During the first week after the community week announcement, **23.06. - 30.06.**, teams will be formed around the most promising and interesting project ideas. Each team can consist of 2 to 10 participants. Projects can be accessed [here](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/flax-jax-projects/22).

All officially defined projects can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpHebL7qrwJOc9olTpIPgjf8vOS0jNb6zR_B8x_Jtik/edit?usp=sharing).

### How to propose a project

Some default project ideas are given by the organizers. **However, we strongly encourage participants to submit their own project ideas!**
Check out the [HOW_TO_PROPOSE_PROJECT.md](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/research_projects/jax-projects/HOW_TO_PROPOSE_PROJECT.md) for more information on how to propose a new project.

### How to form a team around a project

You can check out all existing projects ideas on the forum under [Flax/JAX projects category](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/flax-jax-projects/22).
Make sure to quickly check out each project idea and leave a ‚ù§Ô∏è  if you like an idea. 
Feel free to leave comments, suggestions for improvement, or questions about more details directly on the discussion thread. 
If you have found the project that you ‚ù§Ô∏è  the most, leave a message "I would like to join this project" on the discussion thread. 
We strongly advise you to also shortly state who you are, which time zone you are in and why you would like to work on this project, how you can contribute to the project and what your vision is for the project.
For projects that see a lot of interest and for which enough participants have expressed interest in joining, an official team will be created by the organizers. 
One of the organizers (`@Suzana`, `@valhalla`, `@osanseviero`, `@patrickvonplaten`) will leave a message "For this project the team: `<team_name>`, `<team_members>` , is officially created" on the thread and note down the teams on [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpHebL7qrwJOc9olTpIPgjf8vOS0jNb6zR_B8x_Jtik/edit?usp=sharing).

Once created, the team can start refining their project:

- What is the goal of the project? *E.g.*, Present a language model that writes poetry in Russian.
- What model will we use? *E.g.*, FlaxGPT2
- What data will we use? *E.g.* Russian dataset of OSCAR & publicly available book on poetry
- Should we use a pre-trained model or train a model from scratch? E.g. Train a model from scratch
- What training scripts do we need? *E.g.* `transformers/examples/flax/run_clm_flax.py` can be used
- What kind of demo would we like to present? E.g. Text-generation API of the ü§ó Hub in combination with a Streamlit demo that lets the user generate a poem of a given length
- How will the work be divided? *E.g.* Team member 1 works on data preprocessing, Team member 2 works on adapting the Flax script, ...

We highly recommend that each team discusses all relevant ideas for their project directly on the forum thread. 
This way valuable learning experiences are shared and accessible by the whole community in the future. 
Additionally, the organizers, other participants, or anybody in the community really can read through your discussions and leave comments/tips for improvement. Obviously, you can also create private chats, ... to discuss more sensitive topics, etc.

**Important**:

- For project ideas that see a lot of interest, we are more than happy to create more than one team.
- Participants are welcome to join multiple teams, even though we encourage them to only work on a single project.
- Under special circumstances, participants can change/create new teams. Please note that we would like to keep this the exception. If however, you would like to change/leave existing teams, please leave a post on the project's thread where you ping the corresponding organizer that created the group.
 - It is often easy to propose/join a project that is done in your native language. Feel free to reach out to existing [language-specific groups](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/languages-at-hugging-face/15) to look for community members that might be interested in joining your project.

## Tips on how to organize the project

This section gives you some tips on how to most efficiently & effectively 
work as a team to achieve your goal. It is by no means a strict recipe to follow, 
but rather a collection of tips from the ü§ó team.

Once your team is defined, you can start working on the project as soon as possible. 


### Communication

At first, it is always useful to get to know each other and to set up a means of communication.
While we recommend that all technical aspects of work can be discussed directly on the [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/flax-jax-projects/22) under your project thread, 
it can be very helpful to have a more direct way of communicating, *e.g.* in a channel. 
For this we have created a discord that you can access [here](https://discord.com/channels/858019234139602994/858019234139602997). 
This discord will not be managed by anybody and is just there so that you can communicate more effectively with your team members. 
Feel free to create a new channel for you and your team where you can discuss everything. If you and your team have already set up other ways of communicating, it is absolutely not required to make use of the discord. However, we do recommend each team to set up some kind 
of channel or group for quick discussions.

### Project definition

In the very beginning, you should make sure your project is well-defined and that 
everybody in the team understands the goal of the project and the work that needs to be 
done in order to achieve the goal. A well-defined project:

- has defined the task on which the model will be trained
- has defined the model that will be trained
- has defined the datasets that will be used for training
- has defined the type of training scripts that need to be written
- has defined the desired outcome of the project
- has defined the workflows

By "has defined" we don't meant that the corresponding code already has to be written and ready 
to be used, but that everybody in team is on the same page on what type of model, data and training script should be used.

To give an example, a well-defined project would be the following:

- task: summarization
- model: [t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small)
- dataset: [CNN/Daily mail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail)
- training script: [run_summarization_flax.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/flax/summarization/run_summarization_flax.py)
- outcome: t5 model that can summarize news
- work flow: adapt `run_summarization_flax.py` to work with `t5-small`.

This example is a very easy and not the most interesting project since a `t5-small`
summarization model exists already for CNN/Daily mail and pretty much no code has to be 
written. 
A well-defined project does not need to have the dataset be part of 
the `datasets` library and the training script already be pre-written, however it should 
be clear how the desired dataset can be accessed and how the training script can be 
written. 

It is also important to have a clear plan regarding the workflow. Usually, the 
data processing is done in a first step. Once the data is in a format that the model can 
work with, the training script can be written, etc. These steps should be more detailed 
once the team has a clearly defined project. It can be helpful to set deadlines for each step.

### Workload division

To effectively work as a team, it is crucial to divide the workload among everybody.
Some team members will be more motivated and experienced than others and 
some team members simply want to participate to learn more and cannot contribute that 
much to the team. This is totally fine! One cannot expect everybody in the team to have the same level of experience and time/motivation during the community week.

As a conclusion, being honest about one's expected involvement is crucial so that 
the workload can be divided accordingly. If someone doesn't think her/his tasks are feasible - let 
the team know early on so that someone else can take care of it!

It is recommended that the motivated and experienced team members take the lead in dividing the work and are ready to take over the tasks of another team member if necessary. 

The workload can often be divided according to:

- data preprocessing (load the data and preprocess data in the correct format)
- data tokenization / data collator (process data samples into tokens or images)
- model configuration (writing the code that defines the model)
- model forward pass (make sure input / output work correctly)
- loss function (define the loss function)
- putting the pieces together in a training script

Many of the steps above require other steps to be finished, so it often makes sense 
to use dummy data in the expected format to start, *e.g.*, with the model forward pass 
before the data preprocessing is done.

### Expectations

It is also very important to stay realistic with the scope of your project. Each team 
has access to a TPUv3-8 for only *ca.* 10 days, so it's important to keep the scope of 
the project reasonable. While we do want each team to work on interesting projects, each 
team should make sure that the project goals can be achieved within the provided compute 
time on TPU. For instance, pretraining a 11 billion parameters T5 model is not really a realistic 
task with just 10 days of TPUv3-8 compute. 
Also, it might be difficult to finish a project where the whole modeling, dataset and training code has to be written from scratch.

Having defined your project, feel free to reach out on Slack or the forum for feedback from the organizers. We can surely give you our opinion on whether the project is feasible and what can be done to improve it.
the project is feasible.

### Other tips

Here is a collection of some more tips:

- We strongly recommend to work as publicly and collaboratively as possible during the week so that other teams 
and the organizers can best help you. This includes publishing important discussions on 
the forum and making use of the [ü§ó hub](http://huggingface.co/) to have a version 
control for your models and training logs.
- When debugging, it is important that the debugging cycle is kept as short as possible to 
be able to effectively debug. *E.g.* if there is a problem with your training script, 
you should run it with just a couple of hundreds of examples and not the whole dataset script. This can be done by either making use of [datasets streaming](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/master/dataset_streaming.html?highlight=streaming) or by selecting just the first 
X number of data samples after loading:

```python
datasets["train"] = datasets["train"].select(range(1000))
```
- Ask for help. If you are stuck, use the public Slack channel or the [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/flax-jax-projects/22) to ask for help.

## How to install relevant libraries

In the following we will explain how to install all relevant libraries on your local computer and on TPU VM.

It is recommended to install all relevant libraries both on your local machine 
and on the TPU virtual machine. This way, quick prototyping and testing can be done on
your local machine and the actual training can be done on the TPU VM.

### Local computer

The following libraries are required to train a JAX/Flax model with ü§ó Transformers and ü§ó Datasets:

- [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax/)
- [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax)
- [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax)
- [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)

You should install the above libraries in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). 
If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). Create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going
to use and activate it.

You should be able to run the command:

```bash
python3 -m venv <your-venv-name>
```

You can activate your venv by running

```bash
source ~/<your-venv-name>/bin/activate
```

We strongly recommend to make use of the provided JAX/Flax examples scripts in [transformers/examples/flax](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax) even if you want to train a JAX/Flax model of another github repository that is not integrated into ü§ó Transformers.
In all likelihood, you will need to adapt one of the example scripts, so we recommend forking and cloning the ü§ó Transformers repository as follows. 
Doing so will allow you to share your fork of the Transformers library with your team members so that the team effectively works on the same code base. It will also automatically install the newest versions of `flax`, `jax` and `optax`.

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by
   clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code
   under your GitHub user account.

2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/<your Github handle>/transformers.git
   $ cd transformers
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes. This is especially useful to share code changes with your team:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-project
   ```

4. Set up a flax environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -e ".[flax]"
   ```

   (If transformers was already installed in the virtual environment, remove
   it with `pip uninstall transformers` before reinstalling it in editable
   mode with the `-e` flag.)

   If you have already cloned that repo, you might need to `git pull` to get the most recent changes in the `datasets`
   library.

   Running this command will automatically install `flax`, `jax` and `optax`.

Next, you should also install the ü§ó Datasets library. We strongly recommend installing the 
library from source to profit from the most current additions during the community week.

Simply run the following steps:

```
$ cd ~/
$ git clone https://github.com/huggingface/datasets.git
$ cd datasets
$ pip install -e ".[streaming]"
```

If you plan on contributing a specific dataset during 
the community week, please fork the datasets repository and follow the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-create-a-pull-request).

To verify that all libraries are correctly installed, you can run the following command.
It assumes that both `transformers` and `datasets` were installed from master - otherwise
datasets streaming will not work correctly.

```python
from transformers import FlaxRobertaModel, RobertaTokenizerFast
from datasets import load_dataset
import jax

dataset = load_dataset('oscar', "unshuffled_deduplicated_en", split='train', streaming=True)

dummy_input = next(iter(dataset))["text"]

tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
input_ids = tokenizer(dummy_input, return_tensors="np").input_ids[:, :10]

model = FlaxRobertaModel.from_pretrained("julien-c/dummy-unknown")

# run a forward pass, should return an object `FlaxBaseModelOutputWithPooling`
model(input_ids)
```

### TPU VM

**VERY IMPORTANT** - Only one process can access the TPU cores at a time. This means that if multiple team members 
are trying to connect to the TPU cores errors, such as:

```
libtpu.so already in used by another process. Not attempting to load libtpu.so in this process.
```

are thrown. As a conclusion, we recommend every team member to create her/his own virtual environment, but only one 
person should run the heavy training processes. Also, please take turns when setting up the TPUv3-8 so that everybody 
can verify that JAX is correctly installed.

The following libraries are required to train a JAX/Flax model with ü§ó Transformers and ü§ó Datasets on TPU VM:

- [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax/)
- [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax)
- [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax)
- [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)

You should install the above libraries in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). 
If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). Create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going
to use and activate it.

You should be able to run the command:

```bash
python3 -m venv <your-venv-name>
```

If this doesn't work, you first might to have install `python3-venv`. You can do this as follows:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

You can activate your venv by running

```bash
source ~/<your-venv-name>/bin/activate
```

Next you should install JAX's TPU version on TPU by running the following command: 

```
$ pip install requests
```

and then:

```
$ pip install "jax[tpu]>=0.2.16" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html
```

**Note**: Running this command might actually throw an error, such as:
```
 Building wheel for jax (setup.py) ... error
  ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:

```
Jax should have been installed correctly nevertheless.

To verify that JAX was correctly installed, you can run the following command:

```python
import jax
jax.device_count()
```

This should display the number of TPU cores, which should be 8 on a TPUv3-8 VM.

We strongly recommend to make use of the provided JAX/Flax examples scripts in [transformers/examples/flax](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax) even if you want to train a JAX/Flax model of another github repository that is not integrated into ü§ó Transformers.

   ```

4. Set up a flax environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -e ".[flax]"
   ```

   (If transformers was already installed in the virtual environment, remove
   it with `pip uninstall transformers` before reinstalling it in editable

$ cd datasets
$ pip install -e ".[streaming]"
```

If you plan on contributing a specific dataset during 
the community week, please fork the datasets repository and follow the instructions

model = FlaxRobertaModel.from_pretrained("julien-c/dummy-unknown")

# run a forward pass, should return an object `FlaxBaseModelOutputWithPooling`
model(input_ids)
```

## Quickstart flax and jax

[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is Autograd and XLA, brought together for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research. It provides composable transformations of Python+NumPy programs: differentiate, vectorize, parallelize, Just-In-Time compile to GPU/TPU, and more. A great place for getting started with JAX is the [JAX 101 Tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/index.html).

[Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a high-performance neural network library designed for flexibility built on top of JAX. It aims to provide users with full control of their training code and is carefully designed to work well with JAX transformations such as `grad` and `pmap` (see the [Flax philosophy](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/philosophy.html)). For an introduction to Flax see the [Flax Basics Colab](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/flax_basics.html) or the list of curated [Flax examples](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

### **Flax design philosophy in Transformers**

This section will explain how Flax models are implemented in Transformers and how the design differs from PyTorch.

Let's first go over the difference between Flax and PyTorch.

In JAX, most transformations (notably `jax.jit`) require functions that are transformed to be stateless so that they have no side effects. This is because any such side-effects will only be executed once when the transformed function is run during compilation and all subsequent calls of the compiled function would re-use the same side-effects of the compiled run instead of the "actual" side-effects (see [Stateful Computations in JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/07-state.html)). As a consequence, Flax models, which are designed to work well with JAX transformations, are stateless. This means that when running a model in inference, both the inputs and the model weights are passed to the forward pass. In contrast, PyTorch model are very much stateful with the weights being stored within the model instance and the user just passing the inputs to the forward pass.

Let's illustrate the difference between stateful models in PyTorch and stateless models in Flax.

For simplicity, let's assume the language model consists simply of a single attention layer [`key_proj`, `value_proj`, `query_proj`] and a linear layer `logits_proj` to project the transformed word embeddings to the output logit vectors.

#### **Stateful models in PyTorch**

In PyTorch, the weights matrices would be stored as `torch.nn.Linear` objects alongside the model's config inside the model class `ModelPyTorch`:

```python
class ModelPyTorch:
 
  def __init__(self, config):
    self.config = config
    self.key_proj = torch.nn.Linear(config)
    self.value_proj = torch.nn.Linear(config)
    self.query_proj = torch.nn.Linear(config)
    self.logits_proj = torch.nn.Linear(config)
```

Instantiating an object `model_pytorch` of the class `ModelPyTorch` would actually allocate memory for the model weights and attach them to the attributes `self.key_proj`, `self.value_proj`, `self.query_proj`, and `self.logits.proj`. We could access the weights via:

```
key_projection_matrix = model_pytorch.key_proj.weight.data
```

Visually, we would represent an object of `model_pytorch` therefore as follows:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/lm_pytorch_def.png)

Executing a forward pass then simply corresponds to passing the `input_ids` to the object `model_pytorch`:

```python
sequences = model_pytorch(input_ids)
```

In a more abstract way, this can be represented as passing the word embeddings to the model function to get the output logits:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/lm_pt_inference.png)

This design is called **stateful** because the output logits, the `sequences`, can change even if the word embeddings, the `input_ids`, stay the same. Hence, the function's output does not only depend on its inputs, but also on its **state**, `[self.key_proj, self.value_proj, self.query_proj, self.logits_proj]`, which makes `model_pytorch` stateful.

#### **Stateless models in Flax/JAX**

Now, let's see how the mathematically equivalent model would be written in JAX/Flax. The model class `ModelFlax` would define the self-attention and logits projection weights as [**`flax.linen.Dense`**](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/flax.linen.Dense.html#flax.linen.Dense) objects:

```python
class ModelFlax:

  def __init__(self, config):
    self.config = config
    self.key_proj = flax.linen.Dense(config)
    self.value_proj = flax.linen.Dense(config)
    self.query_proj = flax.linen.Dense(config)
    self.logits_proj = flax.linen.Dense(config)
```

At first glance the linear layer class `flax.linen.Dense` looks very similar to PyTorch's `torch.nn.Linear` class. However, instantiating an object `model_flax` only defines the linear transformation functions and does **not** allocate memory to store the linear transformation weights. In a way, the attribute `self.key_proj` tell the instantiated object `model_flax` to perform a linear transformation on some input and force it to expect a weight, called `key_proj`, as an input.

This time we would illustrate the object `model_flax` without the weight matrices:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/lm_flax_def.png)


Accordingly, the forward pass requires both `input_ids` as well as a dictionary consisting of the model's weights (called `state` here) to compute the `sequences`:

To get the initial `state` we need to explicitly do a forward pass by passing a dummy input:

```python
state = model_flax.init(rng, dummy_input_ids)
```

and then we can do the forward pass.

```python
sequences = model_flax.apply(state, input_ids)
```

Visually, the forward pass would now be represented as passing all tensors required for the computation to the model's object:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/lm_flax_inference.png)

This design is called **stateless** because the output logits, the `sequences`, **cannot** change if the word embeddings, the `input_ids`, stay the same. Hence, the function's output only depends on its inputs, being the `input_ids` and the `state` dictionary consisting of the weights **state**, `[key_proj, value_proj, query_proj, logits_proj]`. 

Another term which is often used to describe the design difference between Flax/JAX and PyTorch is **immutable** vs **mutable**. A instantiated Flax model, `model_flax`, is **immutable** as a logical consequence of `model_flax`'s output being fully defined by its input: If calling `model_flax` could mutate `model_flax`, then calling `model_flax` twice with the same inputs could lead to different results which would violate the "*statelessness*" of Flax models.

#### **Flax models in Transformers**

Now let us see how this is handled in `Transformers.` If you have used a Flax model in Transformers already, you might wonder how come you don't always have to pass the parameters to the function of the forward pass. This is because the `FlaxPreTrainedModel` class abstracts it away. 
It is designed this way so that the Flax models in Transformers will have a similar API to PyTorch and Tensorflow models.

The `FlaxPreTrainedModel` is an abstract class that holds a Flax module, handles weights initialization, and provides a simple interface for downloading and loading pre-trained weights i.e. the `save_pretrained` and `from_pretrained` methods. Each Flax model then defines its own subclass of `FlaxPreTrainedModel`; *e.g.* the BERT model has `FlaxBertPreTrainedModel`. Each such class provides two important methods, `init_weights` and `__call__`. Let's see what each of those methods do:

- The `init_weights` method takes the expected input shape and a [`PRNGKey`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.random.PRNGKey.html) (and any other arguments that are required to get initial weights) and calls `module.init` by passing it a random example to get the initial weights with the given `dtype` (for ex. `fp32` or `bf16` etc). This method is called when we create an instance of the model class, so the weights are already initialized when you create a model i.e., when you do 

      model = FlaxBertModel(config)

- The `__call__` method defines forward pass. It takes all necessary model inputs and parameters (and any other arguments required for the forward pass). The parameters are optional; when no parameters are passed, it uses the previously initialized or loaded parameters which can be accessed using `model.params`. It then calls the `module.apply` method, passing it the parameters and inputs to do the actual forward pass. So we can do a forward pass using

      output = model(inputs, params=params)


Let's look at an example to see how this works. We will write a simple two-layer MLP model.

First, write a Flax module that will declare the layers and computation.

```python
import flax.linen as nn
import jax.numpy as jnp

class MLPModule(nn.Module):
   config: MLPConfig
   dtype: jnp.dtype = jnp.float32

   def setup(self):
      self.dense1 = nn.Dense(self.config.hidden_dim, dtype=self.dtype)
      self.dense2 = nn.Desne(self.config.hidden_dim, dtype=self.dtype)
   
   def __call__(self, inputs):
      hidden_states = self.dense1(inputs)
      hidden_states = nn.relu(hidden_states)
      hidden_states = self.dense2(hidden_states)
      return hidden_states
```

Now let's define the `FlaxPreTrainedModel` model class.

```python
from transformers.modeling_flax_utils import FlaxPreTrainedModel

class FlaxMLPPreTrainedModel(FlaxPreTrainedModel):
   config_class = MLPConfig
   base_model_prefix = "model"
   module_class: nn.Module = None

   def __init__(self, config: BertConfig, input_shape: Tuple = (1, 8), seed: int = 0, dtype: jnp.dtype = jnp.float32, **kwargs):
      # initialize the flax module
      module = self.module_class(config=config, dtype=dtype, **kwargs)
      super().__init__(config, module, input_shape=input_shape, seed=seed, dtype=dtype)
   
   def init_weights(self, rng, input_shape):
      # init input tensors
      inputs = jnp.zeros(input_shape, dtype="i4")
      
      params_rng, dropout_rng = jax.random.split(rng)
      rngs = {"params": params_rng, "dropout": dropout_rng}
      
      params = self.module.init(rngs, inputs)["params"]
      return params
   
   def __call__(self, inputs, params: dict = None):
      params = {"params": params or self.params}
      outputs = self.module.apply(params, jnp.array(inputs))
      return outputs
```


Now we can define our model class as follows.

```python
class FlaxMLPModel(FlaxMLPPreTrainedModel):
   module_class = FlaxMLPModule
```

Now the `FlaxMLPModel` will have a similar interface as PyTorch or Tensorflow models and allows us to attach loaded or randomely initialized weights to the model instance.

So the important point to remember is that the `model` is not an instance of `nn.Module`; it's an abstract class, like a container that holds a Flax module, its parameters and provides convenient methods for initialization and forward pass. The key take-away here is that an instance of `FlaxMLPModel` is very much stateful now since it holds all the model parameters, whereas the underlying Flax module `FlaxMLPModule` is still stateless. Now to make `FlaxMLPModel` fully compliant with JAX transformations, it is always possible to pass the parameters to `FlaxMLPModel` as well to make it stateless and easier to work with during training. Feel free to take a look at the code to see how exactly this is implemented for ex. [`modeling_flax_bert.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/models/bert/modeling_flax_bert.py#L536)

Another significant difference between Flax and PyTorch models is that, we can pass the `labels` directly to PyTorch's forward pass to compute the loss, whereas Flax models never accept `labels` as an input argument. In PyTorch, gradient backpropagation is performed by simply calling `.backward()` on the computed loss which makes it very handy for the user to be able to pass the `labels`. In Flax however, gradient backpropagation cannot be done by simply calling `.backward()` on the loss output, but the loss function itself has to be transformed by `jax.grad` or `jax.value_and_grad` to return the gradients of all parameters. This transformation cannot happen under-the-hood when one passes the `labels` to Flax's forward function, so that in Flax, we simply don't allow `labels` to be passed by design and force the user to implement the loss function her-/himself. As a conclusion, you will see that all training-related code is decoupled from the modeling code and always defined in the training scripts themselves.

### **How to use flax models and example scripts**


#### **How to do a forward pass**

Let's first see how to load, save and do inference with Flax models. As explained in the above section, all Flax models in Transformers have similar API to PyTorch models, so we can use the familiar `from_pretrained` and `save_pretrained` methods to load and save Flax models.

Let's use the base `FlaxRobertaModel` without any heads as an example.

```python
from transformers import FlaxRobertaModel, RobertaTokenizerFast
import jax

tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
inputs = tokenizer("JAX/Flax is amazing ", padding="max_length", max_length=128, return_tensors="np")

model = FlaxRobertaModel.from_pretrained("julien-c/dummy-unknown")

@jax.jit
def run_model(input_ids, attention_mask):
   # run a forward pass, should return an object `FlaxBaseModelOutputWithPooling`
   return model(input_ids, attention_mask)

outputs = run_model(**inputs)
```

We use `jax.jit` to compile the function to get maximum performance. Note that in the above example, we set `padding=max_length` to pad all examples to the same length. We do this because JAX's compiler has to recompile a function everytime its input shape changes - in a sense a compiled function is not only defined by its code but also by its input and output shape. It is usually much more effective to pad the input to be of a fixed static shape than having to recompile every the function multiple times.


#### **How to write a training loop**

Now let's see how we can write a simple training loop to train Flax models, we will use `FlaxGPT2ForCausalLM` as an example. 

A training loop for Flax models typically consists of
- A loss function that takes the parameters and inputs, runs the forward pass and returns the loss. 
- We then transform the loss function using `jax.grad` or `jax.value_and_grad`  so that we get the gradients of all parameters.
- An optimizer to update the paramteres using the gradients returned by the transformed loss function.
- A train step function which combines the loss function and optimizer update, does the forward and backward pass and returns the updated parameters.

Lets see how that looks like in code:

First initialize our model

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

from transformers import FlaxGPT2ForCausalLM

model = FlaxGPT2ForCausalLM(config) 
```

As explained above we don't compute the loss inside the model, but rather in the task-specific training script.
For demonstration purposes, we write a pseude training script for causal lanuage modeling in the following.

```python
from flax.training.common_utils import onehot

def cross_entropy(logits, labels):
   return -jnp.sum(labels * jax.nn.log_softmax(logits, axis=-1), axis=-1)

# define a function which will run the forward pass return loss
def compute_loss(params, input_ids, labels):
   logits = model(input_ids, params=params, train=True)
   loss = cross_entropy(logits, onehot(labels)).mean()
   return loss
```

Now we transform the loss function with `jax.value_and_grad`.

```python
# transform the loss function to get the gradients
grad_fn = jax.value_and_grad(compute_loss)
```

We use the [optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax) library to Initialize the optimizer. 

```python
import optax

params = model.params
tx = optax.sgd(learning_rate=3e-3)
opt_state = tx.init(params)
```

Now we define a single training step which will do a forward and a backward pass.

```python
def _train_step(params, opt_state, input_ids, labels)
   # do the forward pass and get the loss and gradients
   loss, grads = grad_fn(params, input_ids, labels)

   # use the gradients to update parameters
   updates, opt_state = tx.update(grads, opt_state)
   updated_params = optax.apply_updates(params, updates)

   return updates_params, opt_state, loss

train_step = jax.jit(_train_step)
```

Finally, let's run our training loop.

```python
# train loop
for i in range(10):
   params, opt_state, loss = train_step(params, opt_state, input_ids, labels)
```

Note how we always pass the `params` and `opt_state` to the `train_step` which then returns the updated `params` and `opt_state`. This is because of the staless nature of JAX/Flax models, all the state
like parameters, optimizer state is kept external.

We can now save the model with the trained parameters using

```python
model.save_pretrained("awesome-flax-model", params=params)
```

Note that, as JAX is backed by the [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) compiler any JAX/Flax code can run on all `XLA` compliant device without code change!
That menas you could use the same training script on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs.

To know more about how to train the Flax models on different devices (GPU, multi-GPUs, TPUs) and use the example scripts, please look at the [examples README](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax).

In the second part, we will give you a hands-on presentation of how a model can be trained end-to-end with the official JAX/Flax example scripts using Transformers & Datasets. Along the way, we want to give you some tips and tricks on how to best realize your project.

- Talk: From stateful code to purified JAX: how to build your neural net framework
- Abstract: Moving from object-oriented (and stateful) PyTorch- or TF2-code with tape-based backprop to JAX isn't easy---and while running grad() on numpy-oneliners is cool and all, you do wonder... how do I build actual big neural nets? Libraries like flax, trax, or haiku make it easy---but how could you build machinery like that yourself?

#### Mostafa Dehghani, Research Scientist, Google Brain
- Talk: Long Range Arena: Benchmarking Efficient Transformers
- Abstract: Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. So, we now need a well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. I'll talk about a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. LRA is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from 1K to 16K tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on LRA. LRA paves the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models, facilitates more research in this direction, and presents new challenging tasks to tackle.

#### Rohan Anil, Senior Staff Software Engineer, Google Research, Brain Team
- Talk: Scalable Second Order Optimization for Deep Learning
- Abstract: Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs. In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models. Our novel design effectively utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep models, consisting of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator units. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on very large learning tasks such as machine translation with Transformers, language modeling with BERT, click-through rate prediction on Criteo, and image classification on ImageNet with ResNet-50.

## How to use the hub for collaboration

In this section, we will explain how a team can use the ü§ó hub to collaborate on a project.
The ü§ó hub allows each team to create a repository with integrated git version control that 
should be used for their project.
The advantages of using a repository on the ü§ó hub are:

- easy collaboration - each team member has write access to the model repository
- integrated git version control - code scripts as well as large model files are tracked using git version control
- easy sharing - the hub allows each team to easily share their work during and after the event
- integrated tensorboard functionality - uploaded tensorboard traces are automatically displayed on an integrated tensorboard tab

We highly recommend each team to make use of the ü§ó hub during the event.
To better understand how the repository and the hub in general functions, please take a look at the documentation and the videos [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub).

Now let's explain in more detail how a project can be created on the hub. Having an officially defined project on [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpHebL7qrwJOc9olTpIPgjf8vOS0jNb6zR_B8x_Jtik/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet you should be part of [the Flax Community organization on the hub](https://huggingface.co/flax-community). All repositories should be created under this organization so that write access can be shared and everybody can easily access other participants'
work ü§ó. Note that we are giving each team member access to all repositories created under [flax-community](https://huggingface.co/flax-community), but we encourage participants to only clone and edit repositories corresponding to one's teams. If you want to help other teams, please ask them before changing files in their repository! The integrated git version control keeps track of 
all changes, so in case a file was deleted by mistake, it is trivial to re-create it.

Awesome! Now, let's first go over a simple example where most of the required we'll pre-train a RoBERTa model on a low-resource language. To begin with, we create a repository 
under [the Flax Community organization on the hub](https://huggingface.co/flax-community) by logging in to the hub and going to [*"Add model"*](https://huggingface.co/new). By default 
the username should be displayed under "*Owner*", which we want to change to *flax-community*. Next, we give our repository a fitting name for the project - here we'll just call it 
*roberta-base-als* because we'll be pretraining a RoBERTa model on the super low-resource language *Alemannic* (`als`). We make sure that the model is a public repository and create it!
It should then be displayed on [the Flax Community organization on the hub](https://huggingface.co/flax-community).

Great, now we have a project directory with integrated git version control and a public model page, which we can access under [flax-community/roberta-base-als](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/roberta-base-als). Let's create a short README so that other participants know what this model is about. You can create the README.md directly on the model page as a markdown file.
Let's now make use of the repository for training.

We assume that the ü§ó Transformers library and [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) are correctly installed on our machine or the TPU attributed to us. 
If this is not the case, please refer to the [Installation guide](#how-to-install-relevant-libraries) and the official [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) website.

At first we should log in:

```bash
$ huggingface-cli login
```

Next we can clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://huggingface.co/flax-community/roberta-base-als
```

We have now cloned the model's repository and it should be under `roberta-base-als`. As you can see,
we have all the usual git functionalities in this repo - when adding a file, we can do `git add .`, `git commit -m "add file"` and `git push` 
as usual. Let's try it out by adding the model's config.

We go into the folder:

```bash
$ cd ./roberta-base-als
```

and run the following commands in a Python shell to save a config.

```python
from transformers import RobertaConfig

config = RobertaConfig.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
config.save_pretrained("./")
```

Now we've added a `config.json` file and can upload it by running 

```bash
$ git add . && git commit -m "add config" && git push
```

Cool! The file is now displayed on the model page under the [files tab](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/roberta-base-als/tree/main).
We encourage you to upload all files except maybe the actual data files to the repository. This includes training scripts, model weights,
model configurations, training logs, etc...

Next, let's create a tokenizer and save it to the model dir by following the instructions of the [official Flax MLM README](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax/language-modeling#train-tokenizer). We can again use a simple Python shell.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from tokenizers import ByteLevelBPETokenizer

# load dataset
dataset = load_dataset("oscar", "unshuffled_deduplicated_als", split="train")

# Instantiate tokenizer
tokenizer = ByteLevelBPETokenizer()

def batch_iterator(batch_size=1000):
    for i in range(0, len(dataset), batch_size):
        yield dataset[i: i + batch_size]["text"]

# Customized training
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(batch_iterator(), vocab_size=50265, min_frequency=2, special_tokens=[
    "<s>",
    "<pad>",
    "</s>",
    "<unk>",
    "<mask>",
])

# Save files to disk
tokenizer.save("./tokenizer.json")
```

This creates and saves our tokenizer directly in the cloned repository.
Finally, we can start training. For now, we'll simply use the official [`run_mlm_flax`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/flax/language-modeling/run_mlm_flax.py)
script, but we might make some changes later. So let's copy the script into our model repository.

```bash
$ cp ~/transformers/examples/flax/language-modeling/run_mlm_flax.py ./
```

This way we are certain to have all the code used to train the model tracked in our repository.
Let's start training by running:

```bash
./run_mlm_flax.py \
    --output_dir="./" \
    --model_type="roberta" \
    --config_name="./" \
    --tokenizer_name="./" \
    --dataset_name="oscar" \
    --dataset_config_name="unshuffled_deduplicated_als" \
    --max_seq_length="128" \
    --per_device_train_batch_size="4" \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size="4" \
    --learning_rate="3e-4" \
    --warmup_steps="1000" \
    --overwrite_output_dir \
    --num_train_epochs="8" \
    --push_to_hub
```

Since the dataset is tiny this command should actually run in less than 5 minutes. Note that we attach 
the flag ``--push_to_hub`` so that both model weights and tensorboard traces are automatically uploaded to the hub.
You can see the tensorboard directly on the model page, under the [Training metrics tab](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/roberta-base-als/tensorboard).

As you can see, it is pretty simple to upload model weights and training logs to the model hub. Since the repository 
has git version control, you & your team probably already have the necessary skills to collaborate. Thanks 
to `git-lfs` being integrated into the hub, model weights and other larger file can just as easily be uploaded 
and changed. Finally, at Hugging Face, we believe that the model hub is a great platform to share your project 
while you are still working on it:

- Bugs in training scripts can be found and corrected by anybody participating in the event
- Loss curves can be analyzed directly on the model page
- Model weights can be accessed and analyzed by everybody from the model repository

If you are not using a transformers model, don't worry - you should still be able to make use of the hub's functionalities!
The [huggingface_hub](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) allows you to upload essentially any JAX/Flax model to the hub with 
just a couple of lines of code. *E.g.* assuming you want to call your model simply `flax-model-dummy`, you can upload it to the hub with 
just three lines of code:


```python
from flax import serialization
from jax import random
from flax import linen as nn
from huggingface_hub import Repository

model = nn.Dense(features=5)

key1, key2 = random.split(random.PRNGKey(0))
x = random.normal(key1, (10,))
params = model.init(key2, x)

bytes_output = serialization.to_bytes(params)

repo = Repository("flax-model", clone_from="flax-community/flax-model-dummy", use_auth_token=True)
with repo.commit("My cool Flax model :)"):
    with open("flax_model.msgpack", "wb") as f:
        f.write(bytes_output)

# Repo is created and available here: https://huggingface.co/flax-community/flax-model-dummy
```

**Note**: Make sure to have `huggingface_hub >= 0.0.13` to make this command work.

For more information, check out [this PR](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/pull/143) on how to upload any framework to the hub.

## How to setup TPU VM

In this section we will explain how you can ssh into a TPU VM that has been given to your team.
If your username is in one of the officially defined projects [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpHebL7qrwJOc9olTpIPgjf8vOS0jNb6zR_B8x_Jtik/edit?usp=sharing), you should have received two emails: 

- one that states that you have been granted the role "Community Week Participants" for the project hf-flax, and
- one (or more if you are in multiple projects) that gives you the TPU name and the TPU zone for the TPU of your team

You should click on "Open Cloud Console" on the first mail and agree to the pop up windows that follows. It will allow you to use a TPU VM. Don't worry if you cannot access the actual project `hf-flax` visually on the google cloud console and receive an error:

```
You don't have sufficient permission to view this page
```
- this is expected! 

Great, now you and your team can access your TPU VM!

In the following, we will describe how to do so using a standard console, but you should also be able to connect to the TPU VM via IDEs, like Visual Studio Code, etc.

1. You need to install the Google Cloud SDK. Please follow the instructions on [cloud.google.com/sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#linux).

2. Once you've installed the google cloud sdk, you should set your account by running the following command. Make sure that `<your-email-address>` corresponds to the gmail address you used to sign up for this event.

```bash
$ gcloud config set account <your-email-adress>
```

3. Let's also make sure the correct project is set in case your email is used for multiple gcloud projects:

```bash
$ gcloud config set project hf-flax
```

4. Next, you will need to authenticate yourself. You can do so by running: 

```bash
$ gcloud auth login
```

This should give you a link to a website, where you can authenticate your gmail account.

5. Finally, you can ssh into the TPU VM! Please run the following command by setting <zone> to either `europe-west4-a` or `us-central1-a` (depending on what is stated in the second email you received) and <tpu-name> to the TPU name also sent to you in the second email.
	
```bash
$ gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh <tpu-name> --zone <zone> --project hf-flax
```
	
This should ssh you into the TPU VM!
Now you can follow the steps of the section [How to install relevant libraries](#how-to-install-relevant-libraries) to install all necessary 
libraries. Make sure to carefully follow the explanations of the "**IMPORTANT**" statement to correctly install JAX on TPU.
Also feel free to install other `python` or `apt` packages on your machine if it helps you to work more efficiently!


## How to build a demo
 
### Using the Hugging Face Widgets

Hugging Face has over [15 widgets](https://huggingface-widgets.netlify.app/) for different use cases using ü§ó Transformers library. Some of them also support [3rd party libraries](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/libraries) such as [Sentence Similarity](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1) with Sentence Transformers and [Text to Speech](https://huggingface.co/julien-c/ljspeech_tts_train_tacotron2_raw_phn_tacotron_g2p_en_no_space_train) with [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet).

All the widgets are open sourced in the `huggingface_hub` [repo](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/tree/main/widgets). Here is a summary of existing widgets:

**NLP**
* **Conversational:** To have the best conversations!. [Example](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-large?).
* **Feature Extraction:** Retrieve the input embeddings. [Example](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens?text=test).
* **Fill Mask:** Predict potential words for a mask token. [Example](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased?).
* **Question Answering:** Given a context and a question, predict the answer. [Example](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad).
* **Sentence Simmilarity:** Predict how similar a set of sentences are. Useful for Sentence Transformers.

You can propose and implement new widgets by [opening an issue](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues). Contributions are welcomed!


### Using a Streamlit demo

Sometimes you might be using different libraries or a very specific application that is not well supported by the current widgets. In this case, [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) can be an excellent option to build a cool visual demo. Setting up a Streamlit application is straightforward and in Python!

A common use case is how to load files you have in your model repository in the Hub from the Streamlit demo. The `huggingface_hub` library is here to help you!

```
pip install huggingface_hub
```

Here is an example downloading (and caching!) a specific file directly from the Hub
```
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
filepath = hf_hub_download("flax-community/roberta-base-als", "flax_model.msgpack");
```

In many cases you will want to download the full repository. Here is an example downloading all the files from a repo. You can even specify specific revisions!

```
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
local_path = snapshot_download("flax-community/roberta-base-als");
```

Note that if you're using ü§ó Transformers library, you can quickly load the model and tokenizer as follows
```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM
  
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("REPO_ID")
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("REPO_ID")
```


We'll provide more examples on Streamlit demos next week. Stay tuned!

### Using a Gradio demo

You can also use [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) to share your demos! [Here](https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio) is an example using the Gradio library to create a GUI for a Hugging Face model.

More to come!
