# DeeBERT: Early Exiting for *BERT

This is the code base for the paper [DeeBERT: Dynamic Early Exiting for Accelerating BERT Inference](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.204/), modified from its [original code base](https://github.com/castorini/deebert).

The original code base also has information for downloading sample models that we have trained in advance.

## Usage

There are three scripts in the folder which can be run directly.

In each script, there are several things to modify before running:

* `PATH_TO_DATA`: path to the GLUE dataset.
* `--output_dir`: path for saving fine-tuned models. Default: `./saved_models`.
* `--plot_data_dir`: path for saving evaluation results. Default: `./results`. Results are printed to stdout and also saved to `npy` files in this directory to facilitate plotting figures and further analyses.
* `MODEL_TYPE`: bert or roberta
* `MODEL_SIZE`: base or large
* `DATASET`: SST-2, MRPC, RTE, QNLI, QQP, or MNLI

#### train_deebert.sh

This is for fine-tuning DeeBERT models.

#### eval_deebert.sh

This is for evaluating each exit layer for fine-tuned DeeBERT models.

#### entropy_eval.sh

This is for evaluating fine-tuned DeeBERT models, given a number of different early exit entropy thresholds.
