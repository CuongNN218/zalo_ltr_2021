# Examples

This folder contains actively maintained examples of use of ðŸ¤— Transformers organized into different NLP tasks. All examples in this folder are **TensorFlow** examples, and are written using native Keras rather than classes like `TFTrainer`, which we now consider deprecated. If you've previously only used ðŸ¤— Transformers via `TFTrainer`, we highly recommend taking a look at the new style - we think it's a big improvement!

In addition, all scripts here now support the [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library - you can grab entire datasets just by changing one command-line argument!

## A note on code folding

Most of these examples have been formatted with #region blocks. In IDEs such as PyCharm and VSCode, these blocks mark
named regions of code that can be folded for easier viewing. If you find any of these scripts overwhelming or difficult
to follow, we highly recommend beginning with all regions folded and then examining regions one at a time!
