# Summarization example

This script shows an example of training a *summarization* model with the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.
For straightforward use-cases you may be able to use these scripts without modification, although we have also
included comments in the code to indicate areas that you may need to adapt to your own projects.

### Multi-GPU and TPU usage

By default, these scripts use a `MirroredStrategy` and will use multiple GPUs effectively if they are available. TPUs
can also be used by passing the name of the TPU resource with the `--tpu` argument.

### Example command
```
python run_summarization.py  \
--model_name_or_path facebook/bart-base \
--dataset_name cnn_dailymail \
--dataset_config "3.0.0" \
--output_dir /tmp/tst-summarization  \
--per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
--per_device_eval_batch_size 16 \
--num_train_epochs 3 \
--do_train \
--do_eval
```
